# Biggest takeaway from this class:
During this semester, I have learned about the wealth of tools at my disposal for completing just about any visualization task in Python. Given that my only other coding experience comes from IS 430 last fall, I am proud of what I have accomplished. I have become far more comfortable with Jupyter Notebooks, with exploring documentation, and with tackling new visualization projects on my own. I also gained greater familiarity with packages such as wordclouds, ipywidgets, geopandas, pandas and matplotlib itself. Class assignments allowed me to follow my curiosity, exploring a myriad of visualization types--word clouds, choropleths, interactivity, and more.  Often, I would run into glitches, and knowing that I can effectively navigate said problems is a boost to my self-efficacy.  As such, my biggest takeaway is that there are many ways to create visualizations, there are many resources to assist with issues, and when good data is available, I can tell interesting and compelling stories visually.

# Improvements for future students:
I have a few suggestions to make teaching and learning in this class clearer and easier.

First, rubrics should be provided and used for every assignment. Rubrics “reduce ambiguity by defining what successful performance looks like,” empowering students to meet appropriate standards (Saunders & Wong, Instruction in Libraries and Information Centers: An Introduction, 167). Rubrics also promote standardization regardless of who completes grading, and they can make assessment tasks go more quickly and smoothly.

Second, either 1) all students should use the same virtual environment with the same packages or 2) all students should submit their work via GitHub to allow for diverse packages to be used. In either case, it would be beneficial to take the entire first day of class to complete a demonstration, setup, and sample assignment turn-in. This way, you as a teacher will be able to provide much quicker feedback because there will be fewer issues viewing students’ notebooks.

Third, greater asynchronous instruction should be provided. Excluding Spring Break, there were 15 weeks of class. Due to outside circumstances, 5 classes were cancelled completely, and 2 were held asynchronously, though almost always we were told to work on current assignments with no new course material. On weeks when we are unable to have class, longer video lectures, slideshows, follow-along notebooks, and assigned readings should be provided to ensure that learning continues.
